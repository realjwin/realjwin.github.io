      <description>I am an MS/PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. My research area is at the intersection of wireless communications and machine learning. I am also rapidly becoming interested in financial systems, specifically: market trading, mechanism design, and (cringe) blockchain.
In my free time I am also an avid outdoor adventurer. My favorite activity is backcountry skiing, but I also enjoy cycling, climbing, and backpacking. I love the exhilartion of jumping into new outdoor domains.</description>
