<h1>EECS 451 FA14 Project: Image Deblurring</h1>

<h2>Checkpoint 2: Progress Report</h2>
<h3>11/25/2014</h3>

<p>We are currently developing our own blind deconvolution algorithm that does not rely on MATLAB's built in deconvolution filters.  We are also working on a method for estimating the point spread function of a blurred image using the wavelet or short time fourier transform. One of the issues we have come across involve handling the error function of the image in our deblurring algorithms. We are also having some difficulty implementing our own blind deconvolution algorithm. We may have to revert to MATLAB's built-in algorithm (but we will be in office hours soon to try and work on the issue). Over the next two weeks our plan is to complete the deblurring algorithms and then to compare the quantitative quality of both algorithms by looking at the error from the original image.</p>

<p>From class we are directly applying convolution, edge detection, and a variation of the short time fourier transform to make our algorithms function. We have also learned about many digital signal processing tools that were not taught to us specifically in class, including the Ayers and Dainty blind deconvolution method and the development of an algorithm that reduces image error using the wavelet transform.</p>

<p>It's been a wild ride so far, but the most fun and coolest thing we've done involved using the MATLAB wavelet toolbox to denoise the images and see the results using images with different properties!</p>

<h2>Checkpoint 1: Datasets</h2>
<h3>11/11/2014</h3>

<p>The goal of our project is to define an iterative deblurring application that outputs an image that is comparable or better than a deblurred image that uses a general Weiner Filter (one with a gaussian blur). At this point in our project cycle, we have shown basic Weiner Filter and Blind Deconvolution Methods work using built in MATLAB functions. We designed our experiment by blurring a grayscaled image with three different filters, a gaussian blur filter,  a disk blur filter, and a linear motion blur filter. We then used the built in matlab function, <i>deconvwnr</i>, to implement a Weiner filter to deblur each of the images. We used the blur kernels that were used to blur the images as the point spread function for the Weiner filter. Then we estimated the Noise to signal power ratio by trial-and-error, making small changes to the value until the image appeared to be optimally deblurred.  For the Blind Deconvolution process we used the <i>deconvblind</i> matlab function. To estimate our PSF, we used  an 11x11 array of ones because our original PSFs were 11x11. The results of the of both the Blind Deconvolution and Weiner Filter deblurring algorithms are shown in the attached images.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of what we have done so far is making sure our PSFs are all the same size. From a theoretical standpoint our the most difficult part is understanding more complex blind deconvolution schemes. So far we have learned how the Weiner filter works and how blind deconvolution works. These processes take our existing knowledge from EECS 451 and build on it with more complex manipulation. Our next steps are to write our own blind deconvolution that can improve upon the results we have found so far</p>
